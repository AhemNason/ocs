	<section title="Main Site Home Page">

		<p><b>Top Navigation Bar</b></p>
		<p><i>Home</i> and <i>About</i> provide an overview of all conferences on the site, rather than an individual conference. </p>
		<p><i>Log In</i> allows you to create a user profile if you have not already done so. See {help_topic key="user.registerAndProfile" text="Register and Profile"}. The Log In link will be replaced with a User Home link once you register and log in. See {help_topic key="user.userHome" text="User Home"}.</p>
		<p><i>Account</i> allows you to create an account with the conference.</p>
		<p><i>Search</i> allows you to search the entire site or just an individual conference. See {help_topic key="user.searchAndBrowse" text="Search and Browse"}.</p>
		<p><b>Right Navigation Bar</b></p>
		<p><i>Open Conference Systems</i> link will take you to the Public Knowledge Project website, which provides resources for OCS system and OA research and practice.</p>
		<p><i>Conference Help</i> link provides context-dependent online help.</p>
		<p>Form under <i>User</i> allows you to log in with username and password. After logging in you will be taken to your User Home page. Once logged in, there will be links under <i>User</i> to a list of conferences you have registered, and to your account.</p>
		<p><i>Language</i> allows you to choose the language supported by OCS.</p>
		<p>The search field under <i>Conference Content</i> allows you to conduct basic search through the site with a few criteria. For an advanced search, use the Search link on the top navigation bar.</p>	
		<p><i>Font Size</i> allows you to adjust the font size of the site.</p>]]>
