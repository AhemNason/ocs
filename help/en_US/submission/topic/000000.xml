		(2) they may click on Conference Homepage to learn about the Current Conferences, and if available, on Conference Information page select Proposal Submission, or Call for Papers which also provides a link to submissons - both require registration and login for proceeding.</p>

And then the author will be brought to Submissions page where his/her current and past submissions are listed, and a new submission can be initiated.  </p>]]>
