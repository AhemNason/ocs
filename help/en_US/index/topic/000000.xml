		<![CDATA[<p>Online Conference Help for Open Conference Systems (OCS) is designed to assist users in the process of managing an entire conference - creating a conference web site, arranging time and location for conference presentations and events, submitting, reviewing and posting conference papers, registering attendees, and indexing and sharing the resulting proceedings. It is also intended to serve as a manual for OCS that describes the scope and work process of this conference management software. The Help document also provides editorial advice on common practices in scholarly conference publishing. In addition to this Help document, users can contact the conference's technical support under People on About the Conference page. </p>
		<p>Because OCS employs designated roles for particular tasks of a certain phase &mdash; from the Conference Manager who establishes the scheduled conference to the Author who proofreads the galleys &mdash; each topic covered in Help document refers to each role performing each task. Thus access to the Help document is determined by who is doing what where within the system. Online help is situation-dependent; what one views depends on one's role. Users can have more than one role in OCS (a Reviewer can also be an Author and a Conference Manager can also be a Director). What one views also depends on the task status of that role within OCS. Help topics come up synchronously with the role and its task status, although the user can browse from where he/she is to other related topics. </p>
