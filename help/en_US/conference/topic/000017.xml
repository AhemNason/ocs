		<![CDATA[<p>Two options are for defining the organizing team which will appear under People on About the Conference page. A list of people will be automatically generated by the system based on their current roles; users registered as Directors, Track Directors, Reviewers will be shown in their respctiive roles on the list. Alternatively, Conference Manager can arrange the organizing team by selecting the second radio button, and press "Record"; first choose "Create Organizing Team Title", and enter the title name, next choose "Membership" and then "Add Memeber" to enroll appropriate people to an organizing team from the list of existing users. </p>]]>
