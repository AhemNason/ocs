		<![CDATA[<p>The Conference Manager can use Scheduler to make arrangements of times and locations regarding conference presentations and any other events: first define buildings and rooms as well as time blocks, and then drag and drop items under unscheduled presentations and unscheduled events into appropriate time block, and designate a building and room for each of them.</p>
            <p>For presentations, once they have gone through editorial process and been accepted, they will appear under Unscheduled Presentations.</p>
            <p>For events, once they are created by clicking on Special Events under Rooms &amp; Events, they will appear under Unscheduled Events. </p>]]>
