		<![CDATA[<p>As noted in the introductory statement of conference management, Conference Manager's role is to manage conference in three main strands: a conference website, a scheduled conference, and users involved in the conference. Conference Manager can use a variety of functionalities available to help configure the conference site, such as Email Templates, Reading Tools, Files Browser, System Plugins, etc., and to check site and conference status by Event Log and Conference Statistics. Additionally, Conference Manager is responsible for building up a conference by working out its scope, timeline, tracks, program, times and locations for presentations and events, submission and review guidelines, etc., and handling registration issues. What's more, for user administration, Conference Manager can enroll existing users or create new users, and manipulate user account.</p>]]>
