		<![CDATA[<p>It provides a fast and easy way for the Conference Manager to perform task to the target user. All registered users with this conference are shown on the list, while certain user can be sorted out by a particular role or by search criteria in their names, etc. The Conference Manager is able to temporarily log in as any user by "log in as", thus the Conference Manager, in the role of that user, can complete a required task or to provide assistance. Additionally, the Conference Manager can edit, remove, or disable a user' account.</p>
		<p>The Conference Manager can either select individual existing users by checking the box beside user name or all existing users by clicking on "select all", so as to do the task - "Enroll Existing User", or "Send Email" to an individual or to a group. It also allows to create new user, or to synchronize enrollment of users, that is, enrolling all users enrolled in the specified role in the specified conference into the same role in this conference.</p>]]>
