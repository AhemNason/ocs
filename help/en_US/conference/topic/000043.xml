		<![CDATA[<p>Each set of Related Items based on field and discipline consists of multiple contexts with each context in turn consisting of a number of searches. These searches, and the contexts they are grouped into, can be created, edited or deleted. Both can be reordered.</p>
		<p><i>Edit Context Metadata</i>. The Conference Manager can edit the title, abbreviation, and description of the context. It also provides options to determine whether the author's name (e.g., for use with Author's Other Works, or citations to this paper), or geographical indexing terms will be used for the searching of the database. Another option, used with Definition of Terms, allows the reader to select the search term by double clicking on any word in the html text. The Conference Manager can use these options to configure their reading tools.</p>
		<p><i>Edit Search</i>. The Conference Manager can edit or delete the search URL for each database. For each database, a URL is provided that will enable the reader to learn more about the database, and a URL that enables the search to be conducted. There are two types of searches that can be set up, a GET search, and if that will not work with the database, a POST search is also supported.</p>]]>
