		<![CDATA[<p>OCS supports multilingual conferences, as well as conferences in languages other than English. Languages made available for the system are listed on Languages page in the Site Administration area, and can be selected for use being installed as new locales. On Languages page in Conference Site Management, if more than one language is selected as Supported Locales and saved, users will be able to toggle between languages via a dropdown menu of "Form Language" on the pages of conference website, and "Language" in the right sidebar of interface. By this, users will be free to view the page and to enter data in any enabled language.</p>]]>
