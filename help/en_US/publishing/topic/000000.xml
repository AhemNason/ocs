The online published proceedings can be accessed by Presentations and Authors under Conference Information on Conference Home page. The publications are categorized according to conference tracks, provided with links to abstracts, PDF/HTML full texts, PPT slides, MP3 files, etc., next to the title, illustrated by <a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/ocs/pkp2007/index.php/pkp/1/schedConf/presentations" target="_blank">PKP Scholarly Publishing Conference 2007</a>. Relevant contents can be sorted out by selecting a particular conference track, the initial of author's last name, or by specifying what contained within the title or the author name. </p>]]>
