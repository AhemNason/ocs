		<![CDATA[<p>Once logged in, by selecting Author under a conference title on User Home page, the Author is led to the Active Submissions page, listed with the submissions currently in the editorial process. The Author can turn to past submissions to the conference under Archive, or submit a new one by following the link under "Start Here to Submit a Paper to this Conference".</p>
		<p>The Author is able to submit items directly to the conference by following five steps in submitting Full Proposal or Abstract and Proposal together. The Author is asked to select conference track and check off submission checklist, to provide metadata or indexing information for the submission, and to upload submission. The Author can also upload supplementary files, in the form of research instruments, data sets, or source texts that will enrich the submission. The Author may complete all steps at one time, or stop at any step and return later. In the latter case, the Author may click on the submission title to continue from the point saved last time. Upon completion, click on Active Submission. </p>
           <p>For submitting an Abstract, there are only first two steps. </p>
           <p>For submitting an Abstract followed by Presentation, the Author does the first two steps and leaves the next three steps after "Invite Presentation" is decided by the Track Director.</p>]]>
