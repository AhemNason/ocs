		<![CDATA[<p>Once logged in, the Author is led to the Active Submissions page, listed with the submissions currently in the editorial process. The Author can turn to past submissions to the conference under Archive, or submit a new paper for consideration by clicking the link under "Start Here to Submit a Paper to this Conference".</p>
		<p>The Author is able to submit items directly to the conference by following four steps. The Author is asked to check off submission checklist and select conference track, to upload submission and to provide metadata or indexing information for the submission. The Author can also upload supplementary files, in the form of research instruments, data sets, or source texts that will enrich the submission. The Author may complete all steps at one time, or stop at any step and come back later. In the latter case, the Author may click on the submission title to continue from the point saved last time, or undo the incomplete submission by selecting "Delete".</p>]]>
