		<![CDATA[<p>What listed in Submissions In Review queue are subject to review by the Reviewer that leads to a decision by the Track Director for accepting or declining the submission. By clicking on a submission title in the queue, the Track Director is taken to the submission's Review page, where the Peer Review will be conducted and Director Decision be made. </p>
		<p>The Review page provides a platform for the Track Director to manage the review process. The Track Director can produce a Review Version of the submission, assign one or more Reviewers to the submission, and enter a Director Decision. Depending on the Director Decision, the submission will be moved from the In Review queue to either the Presentations queue or the Archives queue. The submission may be sent to Layout before and/or after going to Presentations list. </p>
