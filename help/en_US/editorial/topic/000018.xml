		<![CDATA[<p>Each submission to the conference first enters the Unassigned queue. The Director clicks on Unassigned under Submissions on Director Home page, then on the submission title on Unassigned page. This takes the Director to the Summary page where a Track Director, another Director, or himself/herself can be assigned. Clicking on Add Track Director displays a list of Track Directors available, with their names, conference tracks, the number of completed and active assignments. Click on "Assign" under Action next to the name of a Track Director, and a prepared email will be generated to that Track Director. When a submission is assigned to a Track Director, it will move from the Unassigned queue to In Review queue.</p>]]>
