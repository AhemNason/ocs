		<![CDATA[<p>Once all the reviews are gathered, the Track Director should send an acknowledge email to the Reviewer by clicking on the email icon, and can rate the Reviewer on a five-point scale and decide whether let the Author view the Reviewer's file. The Track Director can view the recommendation, comments and uploaded files from the Reviewer, and must arrive at a decision on the submission.</p>
		<p><i>Record the Decision</i>. The Track Director selects a decision from the dropdown menu: Accept Submission, Revisions Required, or Decline Submission, and press "Record Decision".</p>
		<p>The Track Director should outline the basis of Director Decision to the Author in Director/Author Email Record. The Track Director can also upload a Director Version of the submission possibly with suggestions or comments. Finally, the Track Director must email the Author using the Notify Author email icon. Reviewer Comments can be imported into this email by clicking on "Import Peer Reviews" above the email subject line. Please note that comments designated by the Reviewer as director-only are not imported.</p>
		<p>If the Track Director selects Accept Submission, then after notifying the Author, the Track Director can select a version of submission available and click on "Send" button to Layout. The default Director Version is simply the Review Version, and the Track Director can make changes to this version -- restoring the author's name, for example -- and upload it as Director Version.</p>
		<p>If the Track Director selects Revisions Required, the Track Director should notify the Author by email and include an outline of what needs to be done with the revision in Director/Author Email Record. The Author should revise the current version to satisfy the demand and upload the revised version once more. The revised version uploaded by the Author appears to be Author Version for another round of Director Decision. </p>
		<p>If the Track Director selects Decline Submission, the submission moves to the Archives list, with its status shown as Declined.</p>
